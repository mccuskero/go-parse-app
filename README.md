# go-parse-app

To test with introductory data

```console
go test -v  ./pkg/tupleparser
```

To run with more indepth example

```console
go run ./cmd/tuple-parser/main.go
```

I was suppose to cap this to an hour, so what was not finished dealt with output metrics, which was hardcoded for now, probably 30 min to finish with testing.
